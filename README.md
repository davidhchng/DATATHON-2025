#### Introduction
In this rapidly evolving landscape, Vancouver City FC finds itself at a pivotal
moment. Once celebrated for its passionate supporters and dynamic
performances, the club now faces mounting financial pressures and rising
expectations from its fanbase. To remain competitive, it must look beyond
traditional strategies and reimagine what it means to be a football
organization in the status quo.

In this project we attempt to help Vancouver City FC identify the most impactful strategies to grow its total revenue. With the analysis of three given datasets we were able to come up with the following:

**The Problems**

*Stadium operations:*
- Declining attendance
- Lower in stadium spending
- Limit variety
- Long wait times
- Lack of modern amenities
- Underutilization of the stadium for non-matchday events
- concerts, tournaments, and corporate bookings that could book the space leave the potential revenue unmaximized 

*Merchandise sales:*

- Inconsistent sales
- Overall volume sales declined
- Engagement outside the younger audience has weakened
- Seasonal spikes are not enough to maintain steady year-round sales
- Online stores face challenges with logistics, product variety, and limited international reach
- Shipping delays and minimal global marketing = unable to reach global audiences
- The Instadium store has lower traffic and declining attendance

*Fanbase engagement:*

*Domestic:*
- Difficulty maintaining engagement outside major cities and peak seasons
- Competing entertainment options and the rising cost of attendance 
- Need to convert casual viewers to long-term fans
- Outside of younger fans, the audience is not engaged and connected
- Reduced media coverage 
- Need to strengthen club and audience connection
-Fans interact every once in a while and need consistent interaction/loyalty

*International:*

- Limited outreach campaigns
- Language accessibility
- Lack of localized content 
-Need pathways to become active supporters: regional fan clubs, more merchandise availability
